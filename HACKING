Some tips for hacking/debugging the applets:

1) The Panel Applet Writer's Reference Manual, including the MatePanelApplet
   library documentation, can be found in mate-panel/doc/reference/panel-applet
   (source). It is not completely up to date, but it covers the basics of
   writing an applet.

2) Look at the other applet implementations. One of the simpler applets is
   the fish applet, which lives in mate-panel/applets/fish.

3) Be weary of static, global variables if you plan to allow the user
   to be able to add multiple instances of the applet. Each instance will
   share the static varible. This is described in the debugging article, under
   "Other considerations".
