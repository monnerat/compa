                    !!! Compa is now a Mate panel applet !!!

Originally designed by Ofer Kashayov for the obsolete Gnome 2 desktop, compa
has been adapted to the Mate desktop panel.

Compa is a Mate Panel Applet that can display the output of any system command
on the panel.

In addition it is able to show the output of a different command in its
tooltip, and launch another command when clicked.

Compa text style can be modified using Text Attribute Markup Language
(http://library.gnome.org/devel/pango/stable/PangoMarkupFormat.html).
