COMMAND OUTPUT MONITOR PANEL APPLET

Compa is a Mate Panel Applet that can display the standard output of any command
on the panel.

In addition it is able to show the output of a different command in its tooltip
and launch another command when clicked.

Compa text style can be modified using Text Attribute Markup Language
(https://docs.gtk.org/Pango/pango_markup.html).

Many thanks to Ofer Kashayov for having designed the original version for the
now obsolete Gnome 2 desktop.
